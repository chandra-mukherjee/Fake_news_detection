Fake news detection is an AI-ML project that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models i.e. Naive Bayes Classifier to 
classify news as real or fake. It analyzes textual patterns and metadata from articles, helping to reduce the spread of 
misinformation across digital platforms and social media.
